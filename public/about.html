<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>A graduate of computer science who specialises in full stack development is a flexible programmer who knows how to
   use both front-end and back-end technologies. In addition to my practical experience in online and software development,
   I possess a strong background in computer science concepts including algorithms, data structures, and systems architecture.</p>

<p>Using frameworks like React or Angular and front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I develop user-friendly,
  responsive interfaces. I am proficient in back-end server-side languages and frameworks, such as Node.js,
  Python (Django or Flask), database administration (e.g., SQL, MongoDB), and APIs to guarantee efficient data transfer and
  application operation.</p>
